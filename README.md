# Smart-Bathroom-Monitor
## Project overview
The Smart Bathroom Monitoring System is an embedded project developed using the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller, designed to enhance the automation, comfort, and efficiency of a typical bathroom environment. The system integrates multiple sensors, including an infrared (IR) motion sensor and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, to monitor both occupancy and environmental conditions in real time. When a person enters the bathroom, the IR sensor detects motion and triggers the LED indicator and exhaust fan to operate automatically, ensuring both convenience and hygiene. Additionally, the fan can also be activated based on humidity readings, allowing it to respond dynamically to high moisture levels, such as when someone takes a shower. Data such as temperature, humidity, and occupancy status are published to an MQTT broker, enabling remote monitoring and potential integration with other smart home systems.
